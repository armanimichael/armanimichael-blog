My personal blog, feel free to fork it suggesting changes and fixes (both technical and language-wise). <br />
**Please don't use my posts for your own blogs**, I made this repository public so people can see how a GatsbyJS Project is structured and hopefully lean more about web development.

The Blog's theme comes from another repository of mine, [gatsby-starter-mike](https://github.com/armanimichael/gatsby-starter-mike).
