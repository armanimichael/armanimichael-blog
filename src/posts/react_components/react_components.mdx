## What are Components?

Why is [React](/react-for-beginners/) so **powerful** and **efficient**? One of the key features is probably **code splitting and reusability**.

React lets you define components, pieces of code you can reuse throughout your program.

Since the introduction of **React 16.8**, we can categorize components as **Class Components** and **Functional Components**.

_Components must be always_ **_capitalized_** _to avoid conflicts with existing HTML elements._

## Class Components

Before React 16.8, this was the most used way to create Components. They were the only type able to implement **states**, which I will talk about in a second.

Let's dive into the **syntax.** To create an essential component, we could write something like this.

```jsx
/*
 Don't forget to import React! It allows the use of JSX syntax.
 For simplicity, we're deconstructing Components from React, its parent class
*/
import React, { Component } from 'react';
// Inheriting from Component, and exporting
export default class FistComponent extends Component {
  render() {
      return <h1>Cool Component<h1>;
  }
}
```

## Functional Components

Functional Components grew in popularity with React 16.8, they need **less code** and **can access state** effortlessly. They use any JavaScript function notation, usually the **arrow function**.

This is how we can define one (same as the example before).

```jsx
import React from 'react';

export default = () => <h1>Cool Component</h1>;
```

## Props

For now, this example does nothing. We could make this component **reusable and variable**. This aspect of components concerns properties, or for short, **props**.

React uses props to **pass information** from a parent component to its children. You **can't change their value** from the component. If you need dynamic data, use states!

**Props can consist of several data types**. They coincide with common variable data types, plus JSX and HTML elements.

For instance, we could add a variable title to the previous component.

```jsx
// Class Component
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class FistComponent extends Component {
  render() {
      const { title } = this.props;
      return <h1>{ title }<h1>;
  }
}
```

```jsx
// Functional Component
import React from 'react';

export default = props => <h1>{ props.title }</h1>;
```

This is what it looks like when we actually pass it.

```jsx
<FirstComponent title="Using props" />
```

### The children prop

React has a special prop called `children`. It contains all elements passed between the opening and closing tags of the component.

```jsx
<FirstComponent>
  <h1>Children</h1>
  <p>
    Cupidatat velit exercitation incididunt laboris quis consequat irure esse
    anim mollit nulla dolore veniam. Do proident irure veniam cillum sint est
    nulla do commodo excepteur non. Non culpa mollit irure labore consequat
    enim. Nisi mollit laborum tempor culpa voluptate exercitation.
  </p>
</FirstComponent>
```

In this case, `children` is a node containing a `h1` and a `p` element.

## States

When a React component needs to **keep track of** any piece of **changing information**, you can use **states**.

While props are defined only once, **states can change over time**. We can use them to handle events, data, and behaviors.

Furthermore, if we want to initialize a state to a default, we can take it directly from props.

Defining a state inside a Class Component (expanding the example before).

```jsx
// Class Component
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class FistComponent extends Component {
  // Initialing the state
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);

    // State is an object
    // The initial value will be the passed value of the title prop
    this.state = {
      title: props.title
    };
  }

  render() {
      // Let's use the state instead
      const { title } = this.state;
      return <h1>{ title }<h1>;
  }
}
```

For Functional Components, we need to use **hooks**, importing `useState` from React. The syntax looks a bit different.

We need to create a new **array**. The first value is the **state value**, while the second is a **method** we'll use **to change the state value**.

```jsx
// Functional Component
import React, { useState } from 'react';

export default = props => {
  // Defining the state and using the prop's value as a default
  const [ title, setTitle ] = useState(props.title);

  return <h1>{ title }</h1>
};
```

## Updating a state

Now we have a state, what about updating it?

Class Components and Functional Components have their unique syntaxes.

For example, we could **change the title when** **clicking** the component. In this case, we can use the onClick event.

Let's start with **Class Components**.

```jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class FistComponent extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);

    this.state = {
      title: props.title
    };
  }

  // Helper function
  handleClick = () => {
    // Updating the state, use the same name as the actual state
    this.setState({
      title: 'New Title'
    });
  }

  render() {
      const { title } = this.state;

      // onClick event
      return <h1 onClick={handleClick}>{ title }<h1>;
  }
}
```

The syntax for **Functional Components** is simpler.

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

export default () => {
  const [title, setTitle] = useState('Cool component!');

  return <h2 onClick={() => setTitle('New Title!')}>{title}</h2>;
};
```

This is what it looks like. Try to click the title underneath.

## Conclusion

React is a modern and versatile UI library, understanding how components work is fundamental.

The syntax evolved between versions. For instance, **Functional Components** require fewer lines to create. On the other hand, **Class components** have a well-defined syntax, familiar with people with OOP backgrounds.

For the moment, differences between the two are barely notable. You can stick with the one you prefer.
