## Callback hell

In JavaScript, we're used to callbacks. Callbacks are essential and easy to use when we work **asynchronously**. The function we need will execute as soon as a specific event is triggered. Easy enough, isn't it?

However, when our scripts start to grow, we can find ourselves in what's called **callback hell**.

This happens when we call numerous callbacks one inside another. The code flow is **unreadable** and **unmaintainable**.

## Promises

Promises let you work with asynchronous methods, without the problem described above.

Promises are described as a **proxy for a value not necessarily known when the promise is created**.

A Promise is in one of these states:

- **pending**: initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
- **fulfilled**: meaning that the operation completed successfully.
- **rejected**: meaning that the operation failed.

As soon as we call a Promise, it will stay in its **pending state** until the caller function is done. After that, it will return either a Promise in a **fulfilled** or **rejected** state.

### Creating a Promise

The **Promise API** provides a constructor accepting an **executor**, an anonymous function.

The executor consists of two function arguments, one for the fulfilled state and one for the rejected state.

The executor should call only one resolve or one reject. Any state change is final. All additional calls of resolve or/and reject are ignored.

```javascript
const examplePromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  resolve('Promise fulfilled!');

  // The code underneath won't run as we already called resolve above
  reject('...')
});
```

For example, we can check if a specific condition is fulfilled, an event is called, and so on.

```javascript
const examplePromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  // The condition variable should be declared somewhere
  if (condition) {
      resolve('Promise fulfilled!');  
  } else {
      reject('Something went wrong!')
  }
});
```

Let's get more specific, we can detect when a new image is correctly loaded. As you can see, the resolve and reject functions are binded to the images events.

The `url` value is passed to the functions, as soon as we consume this promise we can easily access it. 

```javascript
const loadImage = url => (
  new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    const image = new Image();
    image.src = url;

    image.onload = () => resolve(url);
    image.onerror = () => reject(url);
  })
);
```

### Consuming a Promise

You've probably seen how to consume a Promise already. For instance, the [fetch API](/reactjs-fetch-data-from-apis/) works with promises.
  
The concept behind consuming Promises is easy enough. The syntax uses three keywords:

-   **then**: Promise fulfilled.
-   **catch**: Promise rejected.
-   **finally**: called in any case.

In practice, let's consume the example created before:

```javascript
loadImage(treeImg)
  .then(url => {
    console.log(`Succesfully loaded the url: ${url}`);
  })
  .catch(url => {
    console.log(`Can't load image source: ${url}`);
  });
```

### Chained Promises

Promises can return other promises. In this case, we have a **chain of Promises.**

The value returned by each promise is passed to the following consumer.

For example:

```javascript
const chainedPromises = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  resolve(1);
});

chainedPromises
  .then(num => {
    console.log(num); // 1
    return num + 1;
  })
  .then(num => {
    console.log(num); // 2
    return num + 2;
  })
  .then(num => {
    console.log(num); // 4

    return Promise.reject(num + 3);
  })
  .catch(err => {
    console.log(err); // 7
  });
```

## Considerations

Knowing how to use Promises can significantly improve code readability, as well as understanding how many libraries and APIs out there work.

Promises are **essential for asynchronous programming**. This means that they work great with libraries such as [React](/category/react/) and environments like [NodeJS](/category/nodejs/).
