## What are Generators?

Generators are nothing more than special **functions**. They let you control the **iterator**, you can stop and resume them at any time.

The result will be what you except, differently from iterators like the for...of loop they **keep track of the last operation they did**.

Generators were introduced in **ES6**.

Generators are great for many reasons. For instance, if you use loops inside the generators, they **will not block the execution of the program**.

## Generators Syntax

Initializing [JavaScript](/category/javascript/) Generators is similar to creating a normal function, except for the use of the asterisk `*`.

At the moment, it's not possible to create generators using arrow functions.

```javascript
function* generator() {
    ...
}
```

But how does the generator know when to pause itself? To do so, we make use of the `yield` keyword.

As soon as we use `yield`, the generator will stop.

```javascript
function* generator() {
    yield 1;
}
```

Yield returns its value only **once**. If you have multiple yields inside the generator, every time you call the function, it will move to the next generator.

Using the return statement inside the generator will make sure that, as soon as you have no more yields to iterate, it will return a fallback value or statement.

```javascript
function* generator() {
    yield 1;
    yield 2;
    yield 3;
    
    return 0;
}
```

Calling the generator like any other function, won't return any yield value. To use the generator, we first need to initialize it. Then we can use the `generator.next()` syntax to get the `yield` value. The `.next()` method will return an object consisting of two properties.

- `value`: the actual value of the yield.
- `done`: will result to `true` as soon as there're no more yields.

```javascript
const gen = generator();

gen.next(); // { value: 1, done: false }
gen.next(); // { value: 2, done: false }
gen.next(); // { value: 3, done: false }
gen.next(); // { value: 0, done: true }
```

You can write any kind of logic you wish inside the generator, pass arguments, and use loops. For instance:

```javascript
function* exampleGenerator(n) {
  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    yield console.log(i * 2 + 1);
  }

  return console.log('No more yields!');
}

const gen = exampleGenerator(4);

gen.next(); // 1
gen.next(); // 3
gen.next(); // 5
gen.next(); // 7
gen.next(); // No more yields!
```

## There's more

This is a simple introduction to Generators. Therefore, it is possible to do a lot more than the simple examples I showed above.

Working with Generators can help you out when appling the **Concurrent Programming** paradigm. Their ability to pause and resume at any given time is very powerful. All you have to do is finding where to apply them to improve your programs.
