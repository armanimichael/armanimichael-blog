## What are Interfaces?

**Interfaces let you define a structure** and apply it to either a function, a class, or a single variable.

Different from a function, or a class, an **interface describes how something looks** rather than defining how it works.

[TypeScript's](/category/typescript/) primary objective is **defining types**; interfaces let you create more advanced ones starting from the primitives.

## Give me an example

Let's suppose you have a function accepting an argument named company, such as the one below.

```typescript
function displayCompanyInfo(company) {
  return `Welcome to ${company.name}, there're ${company.employees.length} people working here!`;
}
```

In TypeScript, the **argument will automatically be of type any if not specified.**

We know that the argument is an object and should contain a couple of properties. Let's suppose the object accepted by the function looks like this.

```typescript
const company = {
  name: 'Somename',
  employees: ['John', 'Michael', 'Giulia'],
};
```

There isn't any primitive type to represent this data. What we can do is creating an interface that describes it.

```typescript
interface Company {
  name: string;
  employees: string[];
}
```

The syntax is rather simple. We need to define a list of properties and declaring their types.

You can now rewrite the example before like so:

```typescript
interface Company {
  name: string;
  employees: string[];
}

function displayCompanyInfo(company: Company) {
  return `Welcome to ${company.name}, there're ${company.employees.length} people working here!`;
}
```

Passing an object with a different structure will throw an error.

## About naming conventions

If you come from other programming languages, you may be used to naming interfaces starting with a capital I → `ICompany`.

However, [TypesScript coding guidelines ](https://github.com/basarat/typescript-book/blob/master/docs/styleguide/styleguide.md#interface) discourage doing so. **You should use camel-case with the first letter capitalized** → `Company`.

## Optional and Readonly Properties

Moreover, it's possible to define optional properties, as some exist only under other conditions, or you only need to work with a bunch of them.

The syntax is the following:

```typescript
interface SomeInterface {
  optional?: string;
}
```

If you want to make sure you can't alter the properties after you defined the object, you can set a property to read-only.

```typescript
interface SomeInterface {
  readonly cantAlterThis: string;
}
```

The same applies to Arrays with a special type. This makes the Array **immutable**.

```typescript
interface SomeInterface {
  cantAlterThese: ReadonlyArray<string>;
}
```

## Function Types

Interfaces can also describe functions. You can define arguments and return types.

```typescript
interface PersonFunction {
  (name: string, lastname: string): () => string;
}

let greet: PersonFunction;
greet = function(name, lastname) {
  return `Hello ${name} ${lastname}`;
};
```

By doing this, there's no need to specify the function arguments and return type, as they're already defined inside the interface.

## Indexable Types

At last, let's talk about indexable types.

By using indexable types, you can specify what type is the index to access a specific record into the object.

For example, a string array will look like this.

```typescript
interface StringArray {
  [index: number]: string;
}

const list: StringArray = ['Something', 'Something else'];
```

You can define it using a string as index.

```typescript
interface StringArray {
  [index: string]: string;
}
```

The only two types supported for index signatures are `number` and `string`.

## Conclusions

I could talk about interfaces applied to classes. However, I feel like it makes more sense to talk about that in [a post about classes and inheritance](/typescript-classes/).

For now, we'll stick with simpler interfaces.
