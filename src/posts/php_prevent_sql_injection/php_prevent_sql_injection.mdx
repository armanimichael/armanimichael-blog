## What are Injection Attacks?

When talking about Web Attacks, **Injection Attacks** are among the most used methods. They consist of running commands people should not be able to run, by **exploiting how Websites use inputs and forms**.

To clarify, if a Website is vulnerable to this type of attack, anyone could run commands on your database and/or server.

## How does this vulnerability look in PHP?

Firstly, **if you have no clue how a SQL Injection vulnerability looks like**, take a peek at this:

```php
$user = $_POST['user'];
$password = $_POST['password'];

$query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE user ='$user' AND pwd='$password'";
```

The **user's input is passed directly to the query** as a string. For these examples, I'm using **MySQL**.

Anyone could run a MySQL command on your database, with the risk of exposing sensible data.

For instance, if you were to write `' or 1=1` inside of the password input, the final query will look like this:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE user ='' AND pwd='' or 1=1;
```

Which returns the entire table `users`, as the **OR operator makes the statement true**.

## Using MySQLi Prepared Statements

One of the easiest ways to prevent SQL Injection is by using **prepared statements**. They come from the [mysqli PHP extension](https://www.php.net/manual/en/class.mysqli.php).

After you connected to the DB you can simply rewrite the script like so (`$conn` is the DB connection):

```php
$user = $_POST['user'];
$password = $_POST['password'];

if ($stmt = $conn->prepare("SELECT * FROM users WHERE user=? AND pwd=?")) {
    $stmt->bind_param("ss", $user, $password);
    $stmt->execute();
    $stmt->close();
}
```

### The syntax

In the first line, we're checking for possible errors when creating the prepared statement.

The `prepare()` method **accepts a string**, instead of hard-coding variables in, we have to **replace their values with the** `?` **placeholder**.

```php
if ($stmt = $mysqli->prepare("SELECT * FROM users WHERE user=? AND pwd=?")) {
```

The second step consists in binding the variables to the parameters using the `bind_param()` method.

The first argument is a **string**, where we specify the expected **variable types**:

- **i** = integer
- **d** = double
- **s** = string
- **b** = blob

The last parameters are the variables we're binding (`$user` and `$password`). The _variables must be in the **same order** they appear in the query statement_.

```php
$stmt->bind_param("ss", $user, $password);
```

Lastly, the final two methods **execute** the query and **close** the statement.

```php
$stmt->execute();
$stmt->close();
```

Furthermore, you could use other methods such as `bind_result()` and `fetch()` to display your output.

## Using PDO Prepared Statement

In contrast with mysqli (which supports only MySQL), **PDO supports 12 Databases in total**.

Another relevant difference is that it supports **named parameters**, which means you don't have to write `?` into the query, you can simply use `:param_name`.

Performance-wise, **PDO is slightly slower than mysqli** (MySQLi is a native extension). Still, it's not relevant unless you have an enormous work-load.

**PDO** is usually the best method to prevent SQL Injection in PHP.

Let's see how's the script looks:

```php
$conn->setAttribute(PDO::ATTR_EMULATE_PREPARES, false);

$stmt = $conn->prepare('SELECT * FROM users WHERE user=:user AND pwd=:pwd');
$stmt->execute(array(':user' => $user, ':pwd' => $password));
```

### The syntax

**By default, PDO uses emulated prepared statements**, we have to make sure that we're using actual prepared statements on the DB we're using.

Therefore, the `setAttribute()` method disables the emulation option:

```php
$conn->setAttribute(PDO::ATTR_EMULATE_PREPARES, false);
```

Similarly to MySQLi, we have to pass a **string** to `prepare()`: note that this time we're using **named parameters** instead of question marks.

```php
$stmt = $conn->prepare('SELECT * FROM users WHERE user=:user AND pwd=:pwd');
```

In the end, we can execute our query using the `execute()` method, with an **Associative Array** (containing the variables given to the statement) as the argument:

```php
$stmt->execute(array(':user' => $user, ':pwd' => $password));
```

If you want to **print the results**, there are a bunch of methods for getting the selected **rows**, such as `fetchAll()`.

## Some consideration

To sum up, as **attacks on the Web can be achieved in multiple ways**, we should keep updated on every possible solution **already implemented** into the language we're using.

In other words, instead of using string methods to sanitize User's inputs and so on (for example defined in a [React App](/react-for-beginners/)), we should us **built-in features** when available.

**User's inputs are one of the weakest components of Online Applications**, keep in mind that once a user has a way to communicate with the server, something can possibly go wrong if no precautions are taken.
