## Introduction

Since the first Websites started appearing on the Internet, the most used method to build them has been Server-side Rendering (SSR). However, during the last decade, a new approach grew popular - Client-side Rendering (CSR).

Let's get into these techniques and their differences.

## Server-side Rendering

SSR works by taking requests from the end-user, **generating an HTML page on the server**, and sending it to the browser. In other words, the server gets a new request each time you reload or request a new page. It doesn't matter if the new page has the same layout, or it's similar to the previous one.

This unequivocally leads to a **lot of traffic** to handle.

The most commonly used Server-side Language is probably **PHP**, despite **NodeJS**, **C#**, and other languages are slowly taking the lead.

Because the HTML file is already populated, **SEO is easily implementable** on each page. Web crawlers can see the page content right away.

### Pros of SSR

- Best option for **SEO.**
- The **initial load** is a lot **faster.**
- Doesn't require JavaScript to run correctly.
- Can **effortlessly communicate** with **databases** (on CSR the source-code is public, we'd need an API in the middle).
- Most suitable for **static websites**.

### Cons of SSR

- **Time To First Byte (TTFB)** is **higher** - bigger files**.**
- **More traffic**, you'd need a server upgrade for handling more users.
- **Higher cost**.
- Less website interactivity (**static pages**).
- Page **reloads** for every **new page requested**.
- Problematic for slower Internet connections.

### Client-side Rendering

Differently, CSR relies mostly on **JavaScript**. When the end-user lands on a client-side rendered website, the server sends to the browser an **empty HTML file** linked to a specific JavaScript file.

Instead of rendering the page on the server, JavaScript computes the page on the browser.

The **loading time will be longer**, but the downloaded **file is smaller**.

As CSR works directly on the browser, you can design engaging and accessible ways to **interact** with the user.

Above all, the most known CSR libraries at the moment are **Angular**, [React](/react-for-beginners/)**, and Vue.**

In **CSR**, the page sent by the server is like a **template**, it gets **populated dynamically** by **JavaScript**: this is what we refer to as **dynamic web pages**.

### Pros of CSR

- **Time To First Byte (TTFB)** is **lower** - smaller files.
- **Easier to implement.** It uses client-side technologies, no need to manage the server.
- There're lots of powerful **JavaScript libraries**.
- More user interactions.

### Cons of CSR

- **Worst** option for **SEO optimization**: the page appears **blank** to any **search engine**.
- **JavaScript needs to be allowed** on the browser.
- **Can't communicate directly with a** **Database,** secrets would be publicly available.
- The **initial load** can be **heavier** - lots of JavaScript code to run.
