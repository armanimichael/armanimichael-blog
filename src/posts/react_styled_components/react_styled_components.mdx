## What are Styled Components?

**Styled Components** is an **NPM Package** built with the intent of easily styled [React components](/reactjs-components). They use [template literals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals) to pass in CSS code into your components, **isolating each style from the others**.

Moreover, **the package automatically manages classes** and **Vendor Prefixes**, so we don't have to worry about conflicts or naming conventions. Styled Components also support [SSR](/client-side-vs-server-side-rendering/).

## Creating a component

As you know, there are different components types in ReactJS. Let's see how to create a **Presentational Component**.

A Presentational Component only concerns the graphical aspect of our component, it usually doesn't have a state, and only contains props.

Therefore, our first Styled Component will be the bare minimum.

For example, **let's create a button**.

In contrast with a standard React component, **we don't need to import React**. Instead, we'll have to import `styled` from `styled-components`.

We'll also have to **specify which HTML element the component represents**, in this case, a `button`.

In the end, we can **pass the CSS code between the backticks** (ACSII Code 96).

In case you want to use any pseudo-class, you can use the same syntax as CSS, but adding a `&` before the colon/s. You can see for example how I used `&:hover`.

```jsx
import styled from 'styled-components';

const Button = styled.button`
  background: transparent;
  font-size: 36px;
  border-radius: 3px;
  border: 2px solid #d64541;
  color: #d64541;
  margin: 0 1em;
  padding: 0.25em 1em;
  transition: transform 0.2s ease;

  &:hover {
    transform: scale(1.2);
  }
`;

export default Button;
```

Styled Components handle the children prop by itself, if you do this:

```jsx
<Button>Button</Button>
```

The result will be this:

<div style={{width: '100%', textAlign: 'center'}}>
  <StyledComponentsExampleButton>Button</StyledComponentsExampleButton>
</div>

## Extending Styles

Sometimes some components are almost identical, and you may only want to **override a few proprieties without creating redundancy**. You can achieve this thought the **styled Constructor**, as it follows:

```jsx
import styled from "styled-components";

const Button = styled.button`
  background: transparent;
  font-size: 36px;
  border-radius: 3px;
  border: 2px solid #d64541;
  color: #d64541;
  margin: 0 1em;
  padding: 0.25em 1em;
  transition: transform 0.2s ease;
  &:hover {
    transform: scale(1.2);
  }
`;

const ExtendedButton = styled(Button)`
  &:hover {
    transform: scale(1.2) rotate(360deg);
  }
`;

export { Button, ExtendedButton };
```

## Passing props

One of the useful things about using Styled Components in React is **passing props**.

In standard React, changing styles using props is inefficient and can create conflicts with CSS files. For instance, changing some styles of an element would look like this:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import './styles.css';

const ExampleComponent = props => {
  const customStyles = {
    color: props.color,
    fontSize: props.fontSize,
    border: props.border
    background: props.background
  };
  
  return <h1 style={customStyles}>This looks terrible...</h1>  
};

export default ExampleComponent;
```

In this particular example, I used multiple props to demonstrate how confusing and messy the code can get using the standard syntax.

While using Styled Components, we can solve this complexity by taking advantage of **string literals**.

Inside of any Styled Component, **we can access props** and using them where we prefer. To accomplish that, we have to **pass in a function accepting props and returning the required one**.
  
Let's go back to our button, this is how we could change its color scheme:

```jsx
import styled from "styled-components";

const Button = styled.button`
  background: transparent;
  font-size: 36px;
  border-radius: 3px;
  border: 2px solid ${ props => props.color || '#d64541' };
  color: ${ props => props.color || '#d64541' };
  margin: 0 1em;
  padding: 0.25em 1em;
  transition: transform 0.2s ease;
  &:hover {
    transform: scale(1.2);
  }
`;

export default Button;
```

To sum up, we're returning the value of props.color or a default value if not set. Obviously, considering we're passing a function, we could implement every kind of behavior without much effort.


## Animations

In CSS, we can create animations using `keyframes`.

The same thing applies to Styled Component, we just have to **import** `keyframes`, and create an animation and reference it inside the Styled Component:

```jsx
import styled, { keyframes } from 'styled-components';

const rotateAnim = keyframes`
	from {
		transform: rotate(0deg);
	}
	to {
		transform: rotate(360deg);
	}
`;

const Component = styled.div`
	...
	animation: ${rotateAnim} 1s linear infinite;
`
```

## This is not all

Besides, Styled Components let us create **themes**, it supports [Server Side Rendering](/client-side-vs-server-side-rendering/), and they're easily expandable.
