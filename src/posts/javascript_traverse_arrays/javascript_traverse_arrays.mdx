JavaScript offers different ways to work with **Arrays**. In this post, I'm going to talk about traversing Arrays, and how to achieve it with different methods.

## For Loop

Let's start with the basic one, the `for` loop.

It's usually the **preferred** one as it's simple to understand, quick to write, and efficient.

```javascript
const array = [1, 2, 3, 4];

for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
  console.log(array[i]);
}
```

## For of Loop

The `for...of` loop is similar to the `for` loop. The only exception is the **absence of an index**.

If you need to **iterate over each element** of an Array, this method works out flawlessly.

```javascript
const array = [1, 2, 3, 4];

for (const element of array) {
  console.log(element);
}
```

## While Loop

Despite being usually applied for other purposes, the `while` loop works just like the `for` loop. It requires **more lines of code**, as it **doesn't handle the index** by itself.

For instance, you could use this method when checking other boolean expressions.

```javascript
const array = [1, 2, 3, 4];

i = 0;
while (i < array.length) {
  console.log(array[i]);
  i++;
}
```

## forEach Method

Differently from the `for` and `for...of` loops, `forEach` is a method.

It is slightly **less performant** than the other loops. Yet, it is great for writing **clean** **and short code**.

It accepts a callback. The **callback** contains the value of the **elements**, its **index**, and the **array** itself.

```javascript
const array = [1, 2, 3, 4];

array.forEach(element => console.log(element));
```
