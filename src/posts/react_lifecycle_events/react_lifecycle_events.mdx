## Introduction

_This post concerns [Class Components](/reactjs-components/) only._

During the life of a [React](/react-for-beginners/) component, different Lifecycle **Events** get called in a particular order. These Events are called **Lifecycles**. They differ by execution-order and by their functionality.

Primarily, we can use **Lifecycles** when we need to **free up resources or/and implement custom behaviors**.

We can divide them into categories:

- Initialization
- Mounting
- Updating
- Unmounting

## Initialization

### The Constructor

As soon as we create a **React Class**, the component runs its Constructor. During this phase, **React initializes the default props, and you can define a starting state**.

For instance, following the [Official React Docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html) example, we could define a Clock component as following:

```jsx
class Clock extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      date: new Date()
    };
}
```

[As seen in a previous post](/reactjs-components/), we can later update the state using `this.setState()`.

Moreover, you can use the **Constructor** to **bind functions to the component**, although you could use [Arrow Function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions) to avoid that.

## Mounting

Right after the Constructor, a few other methods initially run. At this point in the component's lifetime, the **component is visible (or is creating) in the DOM**.

During the Mounting stage, three methods execute, in order:

1.  `getDerivedStateFromProps()` is a static method (you can't use `this`), you can use it to update the state based on the prop value. It invokes every time the component Renders (it's also part of Updating).
2.  `render()` **returns JSX Elements**, it's necessary to call `render()` in every component.
3.  `componentDidMount()` can be used to **fetch APIs** or process operations on the **DOM**.

## Updating

These methods execute **before the component mounts in the DOM.** render() and getDerivedStateFromProps() are both in Mouting and Updating. They can run multiple times during execution.

In order:

- `getDerivedStateFromProps()`
- `shouldComponentUpdate()` returns a boolean (true by default) which **indicates if the component should keep on rerendering**. You can return false when rendering only impacts performances, and it's not necessary.
- `render()`
- `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()` gains you access to props and state of the previous render and the current one.
- `componentDidUpdate()` runs as soon as the component updates.

## Unmounting

Finally, we have one remaining event `componentWillUnmount()`. This particular React Lifecycle Event **triggers when the component is removed from the DOM**.

Usually, this method is used for **cleanups**, for example, when using **timers and intervals**.

## Examples

Let's bring the Clock Component example back for a second. We can implement two commonly used Lifecycles, `componentDidMount()` and `componentWillUnmount()`.

Firstly, we need to create a timer to update the clock's time, we'll do this in `componentDidMount()`:

```jsx
componentDidMount() {
  this.timer = setInterval(
    () => this.tick(),
    1000
  );
}
```

This timer will update every second (1000 milliseconds), calling the tick method below:

```jsx
tick() {
  this.setState({
    date: new Date()
  });
}
```

At this point, we have to display the time via some JSX Elements in the render method:

```jsx
render() {
	const { date } = this.state;
	return <h1>Current time: { date.toLocaleTimeString() }</h1>;
}
```

As soon as the component unmounts, `this.timer` will still run, risking to cause problems we don't want to deal with. Thus, we can clean `this.timer` inside `componentWillUnmount()`:

```jsx
componentWillUnmount() {
	clearInterval(this.timer);
}
```

It's good practice to write `render()` at the **end of the class**, and our **custom methods after Lifecycles**. Let's see the final component:

```jsx
import React from 'react';

class Clock extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);

    this.state = {
      date: new Date(),
    };
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    this.timer = setInterval(() => this.tick(), 1000);
  }

  componentWillUnmount() {
    clearInterval(this.timer);
  }

  tick() {
    this.setState({
      date: new Date(),
    });
  }

  render() {
    const { date } = this.state;
    return <h1>Current time: {date.toLocaleTimeString()}</h1>;
  }
}
```

## Possible improvements

Previously, we defined the `state` **inside the Constructor**. This technique is totally valid, however, a shorter way to define a state exists:

```jsx
class Clock extends React.Component {
  state = {
    date: new Date(),
  };

  // Continues...
}
```

As you can see, we can easily define the initial state directly inside the Class.

## Conclusions

Correctly using Lifecycle Events can significantly improve our React Apps performances, as well as giving us greater control over our Components.
