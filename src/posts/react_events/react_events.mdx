## Introduction

We know [React](/category/react/) is a library for building User Interfaces. Hence, we need a way to **interact** with the user.

## Events in JavaScript

Events already exist in [JavaScript](/category/javascript/). Events record any particular interaction with the HTML page, which is later handled by **Events Handlers**.

Events Handlers are bound to their respective HTML Component. For example, if we want to register a mouse click in plain HTML, we can do this.

JavaScript code must be in a string!

```html
<h1 onclick="alert('Hello there!')">Click me!</h1>
```

Alternatively, we can pass a function to the handler, which is also better for **code readability**.

```html
<script>
  function handleClick() {
    alert('Hello there!');
  }
</script>

<h1 onclick="handleClick()">Click me!</h1>
```

## Events in React

Events in React are almost identical to JavaScript.

The main differences are that React events are named using camelCase, rather than lowercase. For instance, instead of writing "onclick", we have to write "onClick".

Moreover, with JSX, we can **pass functions** instead of strings to the events.

Going back to the previous example in plain JavaScript, we can rewrite that in React like so.

### Functional Component example

```jsx
import React from 'react';

const ClickMe = () => {
  const handleClick = e => {
    alert('Hello there!');
  };

  return <h1 onClick={handleClick}>Click me!</h1>;
};

export default ClickMe;
```

### Class Component example

```jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class ClickMe extends Component {
  handleClick() {
    alert('Hello world!');
  }

  render() {
    return <h1 onClick={this.handleClick}>Click me!</h1>;
  }
}

export default ClickMe;
```

Another detail to keep in mind when working with [Class Components](/reactjs-components/) is **biding**. If we want to refer to `this` inside the Event Handler, we need to bind the function to the class.

```jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class ClickMe extends Component {
  constructor() {
    super();

    this.state = { clicked: false };
    this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this);
  }

  handleClick() {
    this.setState({
      clicked: !this.state.clicked,
    });
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <>
        <h1 onClick={this.handleClick}>Click me!</h1>
        <p>{this.state.clicked ? '♣' : '♠'}</p>
      </>
    );
  }
}

export default ClickMe;
```

A simpler option would be using arrow functions.

```jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class ClickMe extends Component {
  state = { clicked: false };

  handleClick = () => {
    this.setState({
      clicked: !this.state.clicked,
    });
  };

  render() {
    return (
      <>
        <h1 onClick={this.handleClick}>Click me!</h1>
        <p>{this.state.clicked ? '♣' : '♠'}</p>
      </>
    );
  }
}

export default ClickMe;
```

When we create an Event Handler, we may want to pass other arguments rather than the Event Object only. For this purpose, we can work around it like this.

```jsx
...

<h1 onClick={(e) => handleClick(customArgument, e)}>Click me!</h1>

...
```

## Far Beyond...

Without Events, a React App wouldn't have a single piece of interactivity.

Other important events include loading handling and various optimizations, for example, the `onLoad` event for images.

Working efficiently with Events can take your Apps to the next level.
