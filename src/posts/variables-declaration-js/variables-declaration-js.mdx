## Where it all began

[JavaScript](/category/javascript/) has been around since **1995**. That's certainly a long time for a programming language to be alive.

However, this does not mean it lacks problems.

**JavaScript is the only client-side language that works on every single browser**, which means that compatibility is a must.<br />
Not every single JavaScript functionality is available on every browser since its creation, it takes some time to become accessible globally.

ECMAScript standards helped this language grow, following several rules we're all used in other programming languages.

One of these standards is how **scopes** work.

## The use of var

Before **ECMAScript 2015**, the `var` keyword was the only way to declare variables.

But where was the problem?

Well, when using `var`, we're only using two types of scope: **Global Scope** and **Function Scope**. You're most likely familiar with these two terms.

A **Global Variable** is a variable declared outside of any function. It's **accessible from anywhere** within your JavaScript program.

```JavaScript
// Global Variable

var text = 'Something';

// text is accessible here

function DoSomething() {
    // text is also accessible here
}
```

On the other hand, a **Function Variable** is a variable declared inside a function and **accessible solely inside that function**.

```JavaScript
// Function Variable

function DoSomething() {
    var text = 'Something';

    // text is accessible here
}

// Using text here will create an error!
// ReferenceError: text is not defined
```

Function Variables can also work this way, which is also what we should avoid as it's kind of confusing:

```JavaScript
// Function Variable

function DoSomething() {
    if (true) {
        var text = 'Something';

        // text is accessible here
    }

    // text is accessible here
}

// Using text here will create an error!
// ReferenceError: text is not defined
```

## What about let and const?

With the introduction of `let` and `const`, JavaScript gained the ability to understand block scopes.

What is a scope, you may ask? **A scope is anything between two curly brackets.**

```javascript
{
  // Hello there, I'm a scope!
}

{
  // This is another scope.
}
```

Using block scopes is natural in almost every programming language. It reduces confusion and makes the code more readable.

### Let

The `let` keyword is similar to var. The only exception is that it allows block scoping. Let's take the second example from above and convert it using `let`.

```javascript
// let use

function DoSomething() {
  if (true) {
    let text = 'Something';

    // text is accessible here
  }

  // Using text here will create an error!
  // ReferenceError: text is not defined
}

// Using text here will create an error!
// ReferenceError: text is not defined
```

You can see how calling `text` outside of the `if` scope cause an error.

### Const

The `const` keyword defines a constant, which can't be re-declared and, it is read-only. Note that constants are not immutable. You can still edit objects and arrays.

Apart from that, it follows the **same scoping rules as** `let`.

```javascript
const PI = 3.14;

PI = 2; // Error, you can't reassign a variable value
```

By default, you should stick with `const` when programming. If you need to reassign the variables, you can change the keyword to `let`.

This helps to avoid errors.

## In brief, should I use var?

The var keyword **can lead to unexpected behaviors**. You should **avoid it if possible**, especially when working with [TypeScript](/category/typescript/).

Keep in mind, knowing about var is fundamental, as it is a core JavaScript feature still supported by every browser.

## Conclusions

This post serves as an additional explanation material from my posts about [TypeScript](/category/typescript/). Moreover, this topic is important when talking about JavaScript in general.
