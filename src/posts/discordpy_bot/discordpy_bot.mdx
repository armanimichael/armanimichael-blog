## Why Discord?

[Discord](https://discordapp.com/) is a VoIP application, widely used among video gaming communities and particularly useful in these periods, stuck home because of the virus.

Discord lets you manage big voice and chat servers. **Auto-moderate** chats and users can significantly improve everybody's life on your server.

## Discord.py

Working with [Python](/category/python/) is easy and straightforward.

Instead of working directly with the API, I'm going to use an **API Wrapper** called [discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Installation

You can install **discord.py** via pip.

You can get the library directly from PyPI:

```shell
python3 -m pip install -U discord.py
```

If you are using Windows, then the following should be used instead:

```shell
py -3 -m pip install -U discord.py
```

## Initializing the Bot

Firstly, you'll need a registered discord application. You can do that directly from [discord's developers portal](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications).

Once ready, you can name your Bot and copy its **token**, you'll need it later.

## Minimal Bot

A discord bot continuously **listens to events**.

For example, if you'd like to check for users' messages, you can use the `on_message` listener.

A **Bot is a particular** **Client**, to create one you'll need to access `discord.Client`.

Underneath, a simple example with procedural programming:

```python
import discord

TOKEN = 'The token you copied before'
client = discord.Client()

@client.event
async def on_ready():
    print(f'Logged on as {client.user}!')

@client.event
async def on_message(message):
    print(f'Message from {message.author}: {message.content}')

client.run(TOKEN)
```

If you prefer an [OOP approach](/python-oop/), it'll look like this:

```python
import discord

TOKEN = 'The token you copied before'

class Bot(discord.Client):
    async def on_ready(self):
        print(f'Logged on as {self.user}!')

    async def on_message(self, message):
        print(f'Message from {message.author}: {message.content}')

client = Bot()
client.run(TOKEN)
```

## After this...

This post explored the basics of creating a **Discord Bot using Python**. From here, you're free to expand your Bot by adding more utilities and commands.

If you'd like to see some examples, you can check my [small project out](https://github.com/HeaGleZone/botzoz-discord-bot). I'm working on a Discord Bot for my Server. **I push little updates every once in a while**, but it should be a basic example of a Bot's potentials.

Furthermore, discord.py helps you out with many different extensions. You can use them to split code, easily create commands and more. You can read more on their [Website](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).
