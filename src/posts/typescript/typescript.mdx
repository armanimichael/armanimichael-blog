## What's TypeScript

TypeScript is a **superset** of [JavaScript](/category/javascript/) developed by Microsoft. To make it simple, it encapsulates JavaScript, providing the same syntax plus [static typing](/typescript-types/), **classes**, **interfaces, generics, etc.**.

JavaScript code is also valid TypeScript code. Moving from JavaScript to TypeScript is as easy as editing your old projects.

TypeScript is based on **ECMAScript 6** standards, and it's a complied and OOP oriented language.

TypeScript's syntax is a mix of what already is in JavaScript, with the addition of a C#-like syntax.

## Why using it?

While JavaScript has been around since 1995, it's also known to lack many **modern language** capabilities.

For instance, the ECMAScript standards are not supported on every browser. **TypeScript** compiles directly in JavaScript, using any target standard, making the final product compatible with every targeted browser.

Another significant problem with JavaScript is its lack of data types.

Don't get me wrong. JavaScript uses data types as any other language.

However, you can't specify them, their self-assigned to variables depending on their value.

The absence of data types leads us to **harder debugging** and **less developing tools support**.

Let's take a look at this JavaScript code snippet, for example.

```JavaScript
function divide(a, b) {
    return a / b;
}
```

This function takes in two arguments and returns their quotient. But what happens if you pass in two strings? Or a number and a string? Or arrays?

The **IDE wouldn't know there's something wrong**, we would notice only after execution.

This is where TypeScript helps us.

We can upgrade this snippet with TypeScript:

```typescript
function divide(a: number, b: number): number {
  return a / b;
}
```

We now know that this function accepts two numbers and returns a number. If we passed something else, your code editor (with TypeScript support) would tell us that it's not the right type.

Between the many additions to TypeScript, we can also find improved OOP. For example, if you're familiar with languages such as [C#](/category/monogame/), C, Java, ..., you should know about **Accessibility Levels** when working with classes.

For example, you can now make sure that nobody can't access certain class fields from outside the class.

Trying to do it will throw an error.

```typescript
class Example {
  imAccessible: string = 'fields are public by default';
  private notAccessible: string =
    'Accessing this from outside will cause an error';
  protected kindOfNotAccessible: string = 'Only subclasses can access';
}
```

Moreover, we can also declare **interfaces**. For example, if we want to pass a specific object to a function, we can do this:

```typescript
interface Person {
  name: string;
  lastname: string;
}

function greetPerson(person: Person): string {
  return `Hello my name is ${person.name} ${person.lastname}`;
}
```

It's also possible to reproduce the same with Types, I may talk about the difference in later posts.

```typescript
type Person = {
  name: string;
  lastname: string;
};

function greetPerson(person: Person): string {
  return `Hello my name is ${person.name} ${person.lastname}`;
}
```

## A starting point

This post serves as a general overview of TypeScript.

In later posts, I will talk more in detail about this language syntax and additions.

The first thing I will cover will be [types](/typescript-types/).
