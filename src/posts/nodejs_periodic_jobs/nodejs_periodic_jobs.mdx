## The Problem

While creating a **NodeJS server**, you may have encountered situations where you have to execute particular actions over time, **running jobs periodically**.

It is possible to tackle this problem in several **distinct ways**: let's take a look at some of them.

## Using JavaScript – setInterval

Immediately, one of the resolutions would be using the **setInterval** function, running an action every set amount of time.

Although being easily implemented, this method comes with some **pitfalls**:

- It begins as soon as the program runs, which makes setting a **different starting time** a lot more complicated.
- It will eventually run **out of sync**, making **perfectly timed** events impossible.
- The interval time is in **milliseconds**. You can't specify a **distinct timestamp**.

Using **setInterval** is the easiest way to solve this problem, considering you don't need that much **control** over it.

The **syntax** for **setInterval** is the following. You have to pass a **callback** and an **integer** corresponding to the number of **milliseconds** between every execution.

```javascript
// 1 second interval
const MILLISECONDS = 1000;

const interval = setInterval(() => {
  console.log('Job Executed!');
}, MILLISECONDS);
```

You can **stop the interval** by using the `clearInterval()` method. Therefore, you must use a variable to keep track of the interval, as seen above.

```javascript
clearInterval(interval);
```

## Using Cron Jobs

**Cron jobs** are a utility found in **Unix-like** operating systems. They provide a useful way to **schedule events** and running commands over time.

In our case, we would like to implement this service **generically** on a **NodeJS** **server** running **jobs periodically** on any **OS**.

As a result, **node-cron** (an NPM package) comes in handy. This package uses the cron syntax to run tasks over time in pure JavaScript.

Using node-cron offer many **advantages**:

- t uses **less memory**, resulting in a lightweight method to implement on a server.
- It maintains its **sync** with the **local server time**, providing well-timed events.
- You can have **more control** over every action **tick**: you could run an action every 5 minutes, specifically on Monday, every minute 1, 4, 8, etc.
- You can set the **timezone**.

Before setting up this method, you need to install the node package in your project.

```shell
npm install node-cron
```

The syntax for node-cron it's more complicated than other methods, but it doesn't take long to understand.

## Supported options

```
 # ┌────────────── second (optional)
 # │ ┌──────────── minute
 # │ │ ┌────────── hour
 # │ │ │ ┌──────── day of month
 # │ │ │ │ ┌────── month
 # │ │ │ │ │ ┌──── day of week
 # │ │ │ │ │ │
 # │ │ │ │ │ │
 # * * * * * *
```

## Basic syntax

### Running Tasks every minute

```javascript
// Importing the package
const cron = require('node-cron');

// Creating a schedule
cron.schedule('* * * * *', () => {
  console.log('Running every minute');
});
```

### Running Tasks every set amount of time

All you have to do is using this syntax `*/TIME`, you can also separate values with **commas**, and creating **ranges** with –, for instance:

```javascript
cron.schedule('2,4,5 */1 * * *', () => {
  console.log('Running every 1 hour and from minutes 2, 4, 5');
});
```

### Using names

You can also use common **English names** for **days of the week** and **months**:

```javascript
cron.schedule('* * * January,September Sunday', () => {
  console.log('running on Sundays of January and September');
});
```

Furthermore, you can change the timezone, start and stop the scheduled tasks, etc. You can check out more on their NPM page.

## Expanding your application

Finally, you could implement **ReactJS** for the **client-side** of your Web App, learn how [here](/react-for-beginners/).
