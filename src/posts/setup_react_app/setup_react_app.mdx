## Introduction

Building a React App is **easier** than you think. Unfortunately, setting up the environment from scratch may get complicated. Starting from a template is often a wise choice, **create-react-app** helps you set up a pre-built environment.

- CLI (e.g. [Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org/), but you can use the default one if you wish )
- Code Editor (e.g [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/)

Firstly, you'll need to install **create-react-app** using [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) (it comes with NodeJS). Just run the following command in the shell.

```shell
npx create-react-app first-app
```

Note that the **loading messages don't appear on some CLIs**. Patiently wait for it to exit the execution.

Once everything is installed and working, you can navigate into the newly created folder.

## React App File Structure

Every React Application has its standard structure. Let me briefly explain it:

- **/build** contains the optimized and final application, ready to be deployed
- **/node_modules** comes from NPM and includes every package required for the App to run correctly
- **/public** contains the App's static files. This folder usually remains untouched. You can use this folder to edit the App's icon, title, etc.
- **/src** is where you define Components and the App's logic

## Real-time editing

At this point, the application is **ready** to go. If you wish, you can start making changes to the code. You can visually debug in **real-time** what you're editing by running the following command.

```shell
npm run start
```

Awesome! Now you're good to go! The entry point for the Application is `./src/App.js`, which should look something like this.

```jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import logo from './logo.svg';
import './App.css';

class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <header className="App-header">
          <img src={logo} className="App-logo" alt="logo" />
          <p>
            Edit <code>src/App.js</code> and save to reload.
          </p>
          <a
            className="App-link"
            href="https://reactjs.org"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
          >
            Learn React
          </a>
        </header>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default App;
```

Now try and **edit** some code, then save (ctrl + s). You should see **real-time** changes in the **browser** (at **localhost:3000** â€“ the default browser automatically opens when you run `npm run start`).

## What's next?

Finally, you've initialized a React App, it's time for you to learn more about this library. Go take a look at **how do Components work**, [check this post out](/reactjs-components/)!
