## Introduction

I found this simple problem online. I throught it would be a great example of how to use Arrays and `string` methods. In particular I'm using C#.

## The Problem

[You can find the problem here](https://edabit.com/challenge/SkY5Nw3rS7WvkQmFc). The program I'm writing is supposed to tell if a sentence passed as input is a Smooth Sentence.

### What is a Smooth Sentence?

A smooth sentence is a sentence where the last letter of each word is identical to the first letter of the following word.

## Explanation

Firstly, we have to find a way to get every single word from the input sentence.

We can do that with the `Split()` method, which returns an **Array of** `strings`. This method accepts a `string` argument, the `separator`.

In this case, we can separate each word from the sentence by using a **blank space** as the separator.

Let's write the first part of the method.

```csharp
public static bool IsSmooth(string sentence)
{
    string[] sentences = sentence.Split(' ');
}
```

Next, we have to check if the last character of the initial word and the first character of the previous word are equal.

To do so, we need a loop going **from** **0 to the length of the array - 1**. The -1 ensures we never get out of the Array's boundaries.

```csharp
for (int i = 0; i < sentences.Length - 1; i++)
{
    ...
}
```

We'll also need to find the two characters we need to check against each other.

The `Substring()` method, lets us take part in a `string`, for instance, we're taking the last `char` of the initial word

```csharp
previousWord.Substring(previousWord.Length - 1)
```

and the first `char` of the following word.

```csharp
followingWord.Substring(0, 1)
```

Then, we can convert the substrings to characters using `Char.parse()`.

```csharp
string previousWord = sentences[i];
char lastChar = Char.Parse(previousWord.Substring(previousWord.Length - 1));

string followingWord = sentences[i + 1];
char firstChar = Char.Parse(followingWord.Substring(0, 1));
```

Finally, we can check if the two words follow the rules of the problem.

If we return `false` as soon as any word fails the test, we can make sure the program doesn't go through the loop
pointlessly.

If the method doesn't `return` before the end of the loop, we can return `true`.

## Tweaks and fixes

To avoid crashes, we should make sure that the sentence doesn't start nor end with white spaces. It's possible to do that using `Trim()`.

Moreover, the check we're performing on the characters is **case-sensitive** so, we should convert the sentence to lower case with `ToLower()`.

At the end, if the sentence contains less than one character, we should return `false`.

```csharp
if (sentence.Length <= 1) return false;
```

## Solution

```csharp
public static bool IsSmooth(string sentence)
{
    sentence = sentence.Trim().ToLower();
    string[] sentences = sentence.Split(' ');

    if (sentence.Length <= 1) return false;

    for (int i = 0; i < sentences.Length - 1; i++)
    {
        string previousWord = sentences[i];
        char lastChar = Char.Parse(previousWord.Substring(previousWord.Length - 1));

        string followingWord = sentences[i + 1];
        char firstChar = Char.Parse(followingWord.Substring(0, 1));

        if (lastChar != firstChar) return false;
    }

    return true;
}
```

```csharp
IsSmooth("Marta appreciated deep perpendicular right trapezoids") ➞ true

IsSmooth("Someone is outside the doorway") ➞ false

IsSmooth("She eats super righteously") ➞ true
```
